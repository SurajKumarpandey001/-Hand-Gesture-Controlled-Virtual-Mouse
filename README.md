# -Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse
This project allows you to control your computer's mouse using hand gestures detected via your webcam, using MediaPipe and OpenCV. When the index finger moves, the cursor moves accordingly. A mouse click is triggered when the thumb and index finger come close together.
